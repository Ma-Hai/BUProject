# BUProject
SEPTA's Wawa Station in Philadelphia opened on August 21, 2022, restoring Regional Service past Elwyn for the first time since 1986. 

We will be analyzing the impact of the station installment on the surrounding community through feedback left on yelp platforms towards the station, nearby businesses, and on changing demographics. We will compare the changes to another region which did not go under such changes. 

We will be using NLP to convert qualitative data into quantitative data.
